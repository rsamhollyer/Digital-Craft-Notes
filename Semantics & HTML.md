# HTML Semantical Elements

Semantic elements give meaning to the document. They don't necessarily DO anything, as you can just use divs and get the same results. However, they do add more context to the document that is being read by someone who does not have the privilege to have full use of their eyes.

A good tool to use when identifying which semantics might make sense for your projects is the W3 school. Here is a link to their web page.

When we view a page, we're usually greeted with some variant of the following image:

It makes sense; a nav bar, some CTA with accompanying text description and an add or something else. The footer may also contain links and other content to use.

But there's nothing technically wrong with using `divs` to wrap all those items in, it would still flow sensically. But if you had to rely on a page reader, then you would have to hope that it would make sense as the page content was read to you.

HTML 5 ushered in these accessiblity tags and others to help improve developers compliance issues as we recognize more and more that there is not a generic user of the internet. By making the conscious choice to wrap content in more descriptive tags and use good documentation techniques, we can create an environment that is more accepting for all.
