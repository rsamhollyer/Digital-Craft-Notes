### Variables
Variables are a method where data cached in memory that is pointed at some 'thing'.
Like math, you assign a variable by giving it a *"Name"* on the left hand side (LHS) and setting it equal to *=* the right hand side (RHS).
For instance:

```python
#Varaible getting the value of the string 'Hello World'
# = is the assignment operator
message = "Hello World" 
print(message) 
# The Variable is using the value assigned to it.
```
Words, or rather, *strings* aren't the only thing that can be assigned. Numbers and booleans (Truthy or Falsy) are capable of being given a variable assignment.
